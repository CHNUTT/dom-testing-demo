# DOM Testing Demo

This is an experimental project for testing HTML and vanilla JS with Jest and `@testing-library/dom`.

## Motivation

I've used Jest and `@testing-library/react` alongside React extensively in professional and personal projects, but I've never tried writing unit tests to test a UI that was created *without* any UI frameworks or libraries.

## Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, clone the repo and then:

1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies
2. `yarn start` (or `npm start`) to preview the app locally
3. `yarn test` (or `npm test`) to run the tests
