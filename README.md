# DOM Testing Demo

This is an experimental project for testing HTML and vanilla JS with Jest and `@testing-library/dom`.

## Motivation

I've used Jest and `@testing-library/react` alongside React extensively in professional and personal projects, but I've never tried writing unit tests to test the UI created *without* any UI frameworks or libraries.

## Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, clone the repo and then:

1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
2. `yarn test` (or `npm test`)

No development server has been added, so you can just drag the `src/index.html` file into your browser if you'd like to preview the functionality of the simple page.
